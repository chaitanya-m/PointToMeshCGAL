Solution to: Find the closest point on a mesh to a given query point.

I used CGAL's (cgal.org) Point_3, Triangle_3, AABB_TrianglePrimitive, and other types provided by the library, primarily because I thought it would be more 
efficient than writing a function to compute distance to a 3-space triangle (edges, face or vertex).

I didn't find an easy way to prune triangles from the search when looking for the closest point on a mesh from a query point. 
Accordingly, I didn't use an ordered container for storing triangles. I did use an ordered container for storing query-result pairs.

There are some limitations, which may be fixed on the release branch. Behaviour is untested or undefined for some cases, such as querying a point on the mesh.

I've left my raw 'process' notes attached below.

I didn't take into account the part in the sample interface that mentioned "within a given radius". I wasn't sure whether to abort the search if no point was 
found within the given radius, and didn't solve for it or add it to my interface.

Initial development was done on dev/scratch. It would normally have gone on to a mainstream feature branch before hitting a release branch, but I skipped that bit. 
I squashed all my commits onto a release branch when I was reasonably satisfied with my solution and believed the pace of modification would be restricted.

One of the tests is designed to run in debug configurations only, using a function in the interface that is also only available in debug configuration.
The first test compares my results with those from CGAL as in the example by Wormser/Alliez and checks that they match.

CGAL 4.4 needs to be installed and on the path. Alternatively, 

I had some issues with const-correctness which are not fully resolved at this stage. It turns out some CGAL functions require non-const iterators.
I was trying to pass an iterator to the CGAL function that converts Triangle_3 objects to primitives.
 
I tried to write an iterator to "track" my const iterator, but that didn't quite work as expected. This is something that needs patching eventually, 
hopefully when the corresponding CGAL function has a version that can accept a const-iterator argument.

The code was written on a Linux box (Ubuntu 13.04).

The CGAL headers and library need to be on the path. Alternatively, use something like:

cgal_create_CMakeLists -s executable 
cmake -DCGAL_DIR=$HOME/CGAL-4.4 . 
make

Where CGAL-4.4 is the folder containing the headers and libraries.
Which is in the CGAL documentation at http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Manual/installation.html.

Development Notes

================================================================================
The question: 
1.The wording asks for an [Efficient] closest-point-[ON]-mesh query.
2.But the sample interface and comment in it ask for closest-point-[TO]-mesh.
(presumably to the closest point in a point cloud from a query point on mesh)

Efficiency: 
For either problem, I can think of corner cases that would force us 
to evaluate distance to every polygon in the mesh. 

================================================================================

Started off with the example at http://doc.cgal.org/latest/AABB_tree/index.html 
by Author(s) : Camille Wormser, Pierre Alliez

The example computes the closest point on a mesh consisting of triangles (stored in a list) using CGAL functions. 
The CGAL example translates the list of triangles into a tree of Axis-Aligned Bounding-Boxes(AABBs). 
There are convenient distance functions that compute closest distance.

================================================================================
Task 1 would require me not to use such a library function, but to implement the 
algorithm myself, as this would be the core algorithm.

I have interpreted the question to be Task '1'.

Problem 1 Notes
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We can't use CGAL's AABB trees as we like. The interface is quite limited.

Problem synopsis: 
1. There exist a mesh M and a fixed-point P. Find the closest point P'
on the mesh to the point P.
OR
2. There exist a mesh M and a set of fixed points S. Find the closest point P in S to mesh M.

Problem specification: I shall interpret the problem as follows:

We are working in a 3-dimensional Euclidean space.

Mesh M is a disjoint forest (!) (overgeneralisation) of triangles, where:
A triangle is an area enclosed by three non-collinear points, including vertices, edges, 
and enclosed area("face").

Tree structure: 
We shall overgeneralize what is acceptable.
Triangles may be connected to each other in any way- they may share an edge, they may share
just one vertex(!!) or may just have intersecting faces(!!!). We will allow for ridiculous meshes.

However, the mesh we actually generate will be one that has triangles sharing a whole edge.

Algorithms and data structures

What would be the best data structure to store our triangles?

We can't really skip any triangle in the mesh given the conditions we've set. Consider a triangle ABC which contains 
both the closest vertex C and farthest vertices A and B to our point P. 

The triangle preceding it, let's call it ABD, may be the furthest triangle, AB may be the farthest edge, but 
ABC is closer to P than is ABD. No increasing or decreasing pattern here, nothing to prune in our search.

We'll have to evaluate distance to each triangle in the mesh... unless we can slice the volume somehow
(which is what the AABB's seem to do). We can't do better than O(n). No matter what heuristic we use to 
'predict' closer triangles, there is always a corner case that breaks it. We cannot prune. We cannot avoid 
an exhaustive search.

Distance to a triangle: can be distance to a vertex, edge, or face.

Efficiency is limited to avoiding re-evaluating distances and CPU/memory advantages gained from using one data structure over another.

Using a vector backed by an array to store triangles is fine- our mesh is static. 
It gives us a bit of an efficiency jump over using a List.

There's no point using other kinds of graphs...


Their code is kept for comparison, to test how different their results are from mine.
